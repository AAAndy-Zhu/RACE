# Datasets
All the datasets we used in experiments can be found [**Here**](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1EQ-LCthZAtEZXBWmuSM4-Z54aB2Nf-jh?usp=sharing), including the counterfactual data generated by _RACE_.
If you use the [**counterfactual datasets**](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1-VEVggJ2Nde9LTLz4leTePfEjIMEciYc?usp=sharing) we provide, please remember to cite our paper!
We will be uploading more counterfactual datasets generated by our _RACE_ later!

# Code
The code will be released soon.
